  ### Current Projects 🚀

  - 🧭 [`MONOid`](https://www.usemonoid.com/) — Real-time workspace engine
  aggregating tasks, schedules, and tool integrations into a unified execution
  layer. Event-driven sync across services.
  - 🗺️  [`IRL Proximity`](https://www.irlproximity.com/) — Multiplayer spatial
  canvas with programmable grid state. Real-time collaboration layer built over
  structured media blocks.

  ### Open Source

  - 🎞️  [`Archive
  Mosh`](https://github.com/interfacingresearchlaboratory/archive-mosh) — Python
   tool for procedurally generating video collages from source footage.
  - 🛰️  [`Datasets for Remote
  Sensing`](https://github.com/interfacingresearchlaboratory/remote-sensing) —
  Curated archive of remote-sensing analysis code.

  ### Research

  - 🏚️  [`Models of Abandonment`](https://www.karlherdersch.com/projects/main/mod
  els-of-abandonment) — Financial mechanisms behind deliberate infrastructure
  failure and governance models.
  - 🐚 [`Pivoting the
  Pearl`](https://www.interfacingresearchlaboratory.com/work/pivoting-the-pearl)
   — Delta-scale computational model of urban growth, flooding, and logistics in
   the Pearl River.
  - ⛓️  [`Choke
  Points`](https://www.karlherdersch.com/projects/main/choke-points) —
  Geospatial tracking of sand supply chains from the Mekong to Singapore/HK.
  - 🌐 [`Sensorium.Zone`](https://www.interfacingresearchlaboratory.com/work/sen
  sorium-think-tank) — Digital twin framework combining spatial simulation with
  civic participation data.

  ### Previous Work

  - 🎈 [`IRL PLAYground`](https://www.irlplayground.com/en-gb) — AI platform for
